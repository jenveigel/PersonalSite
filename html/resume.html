          <h2>Experience</h2>

          <p>That wasn’t no attempted murder. ...I shot the boy Mike-Mike in his hind parts, that all. Fixed it up so he couldn’t sit right. ...Let’s say we had a disagreement. ...Well, you see, Mike-Mike thought he should keep that cocaine he was slingin’ and the money he was makin’ from slingin’ it. I thought otherwise..</p>

          <p>The cheese stands alone. ...How you expect to run with the wolves come night, when you spend all day sparring wit' the puppies? ...Omar don't scare. ...Bird triflin', basically. Kill an everyday workin' man and all. I mean, I do some dirt, too, but I ain't never put my gun on nobody that wasn't in the game. ...I've got a bounty on my head man. Five figures! A man gotta have a code. Come on now, when have you ever known me to out my gun on someone thats not in the game?</p>
